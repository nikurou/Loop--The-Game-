# Loop--The-Game-
A simple story based text game made in Twine! What happens when your seemingly ordinary life constantly repeats the same day over and over again? 

You play as an ordinary college student going through his daily life to school when your best friends, Harold and Kon, try to convince you that your ordinary life is just a video game and reference the need to clear the dungeon located in the boy's bathroom? Excuse me what? 

Please don't use the "Back" button on the top left corner. It breaks the game. You are meant to make mistakes and at the end of the day, the game loops back to the start, keeping all progression you made in the previous loop, allowing you to visit choices you couldn't try previously.

I don't think anyone will play this or stumble across it, I'm just putting it here to back it up as I'm quite happy with it despite it's flaws. But if you do play it, I really hope you like it.

Author's Note
---------------------
I never finished this game as it was very ambitious (too many branching possibilities) but there's probably at least 15 minutes of content to run through. The Dungeon battle system is very unbalanced and grindy, which detracts from the fun, and I never rebalanced it. I really like writing stories that revolve around topics that involve Computer Science concepts and virtual worlds, so this was really fun to do since I actually study computer science. It could do with some polish, so maybe one day I'll get back to this. This was my first real attempt at an actual game outside of some throwaway Unity projects that I practiced on by following tutorials, though this is a lot less complex programming wise. 

Only real programming I did here was the dungeon system, which was a huge hassle because Twine isn't the greatest for programming actual features in. I think I was forced to hardcode a lot of stuff to get it to work, so the logic is a little bit loopy and hard to look at even for me.

Nikurou's game was centered on a looping mechanic.  You played as a student, whose friends were talking about an RPG he's never heard of.  As the story unfolds, he learns several facts that completely shake his worldview.  When he dies or the day ends, he wakes up in his bed and sees that the same day is repeating itself.
The game has a very interesting story, and it is well presented.  The player is able to infer what's happening without being explicitly told everything.  The writing is also very solid.
The second half of the story hadn't been implemented yet, so I didn't get to see how it ends, but I'm looking forward to it.
One issue I had was that there were a lot of choices that ended up having no impact on the story (choosing to go to the gym or cafeteria for example), and due to the looping mechanic, the player is compelled to choose them all, leading to a lot of repeated text.  It also doesn't make a lot of sense for the antagonists to be everywhere you go from a story perspective, since it should be a perfect loop.
Another problem was that you could choose to not interact with the antagonists at all, and the day would end and everything would loop.  This is especially strange since after you learn about the antagonists, and the fact that the day is looping, it doesn't make much sense to just ignore them and go on with your day like nothing's wrong.  These paths just add more repeated text without contributing anything to the story.  I think they should be cut or not allowed to happen after the first loop.
I think there should be more decision trees that can only be beaten using knowledge gained from previous loops.  For example, the protagonist would learn an important piece of information, but it would only be useful earlier in the day, or he had to let himself be killed in order to learn it.  As a mechanic, the looping should give an in-universe reason for the player character to make different choices.  Otherwise, the player could just restart the game themselves.  This would be a very intensive change, because a large amount of dialog or story would have to be rewritten, not to mention the added coding complexity.
Even though I spent a lot of time criticizing it, I have a very favorable impression of this game.  Most of my suggestions can be summed up as: get rid of the parts that don't advance the story, because the story is so good I don't want to wait to read it.

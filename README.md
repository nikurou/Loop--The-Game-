# Loop--The-Game-
A simple story based text game made in Twine! What happens when your seemingly ordinary life constantly repeats the same day over and over again? 

You play as an ordinary college student going through his daily life to school when your best friends, Harold and Kon, try to convince you that your ordinary life is just a video game and reference the need to clear the dungeon located in the boy's bathroom? Excuse me what? 

Please don't use the "Back" button on the top left corner. It breaks the game. You are meant to make mistakes and at the end of the day, the game loops back to the start, keeping all progression you made in the previous loop, allowing you to visit choices you couldn't try previously.

I don't think anyone will play this or stumble across it, I'm just putting it here to back it up as I'm quite happy with it despite it's flaws. But if you do play it, I really hope you like it.

Author's Note
---------------------
I never finished this game as it was very ambitious (too many branching possibilities) but there's probably at least 15 minutes of content to run through. The Dungeon battle system is very unbalanced and grindy, which detracts from the fun, and I never rebalanced it. I really like writing stories that revolve around topics that involve Computer Science concepts and virtual worlds, so this was really fun to do since I actually study computer science. It could do with some polish, so maybe one day I'll get back to this. This was my first real attempt at an actual game outside of some throwaway Unity projects that I practiced on by following tutorials, though this is a lot less complex programming wise. 

Only real programming I did here was the dungeon system, which was a huge hassle because Twine isn't the greatest for programming actual features in. I think I was forced to hardcode a lot of stuff to get it to work, so the logic is a little bit loopy and hard to look at even for me.

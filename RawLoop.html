Harold nodded, &quot;Yeah, though it&#39;s a bit troublesome. As NPC&#39;s have their own realistic A.I.&#39;s, our characters are managed by A.I. after we log off and live their own lives as to not cause any logic errors in the world such as us dissapearing when logging off.

Haroon purses his lips for a moment as if thinking, before he finally looks at you and says, &quot;The World Tree has to be the big tree right here, that I can be certain of. However, Irregular one, I can only think that it refers to you, Atlam.&quot;

&quot;What are you saying Haroon?&quot; asked Karn with a frown.

&quot;Well, I didn&#39;t say anything about it at first, but don&#39;t you find it strange? Atlam is a lot stronger than us now even though we all started at the same time. Don&#39;t get me wrong Atlam, it&#39;s not a bad thing by any means, but if anyone is irregular, it must be you Atlam.&quot;

You cleave the last enemy with your claymore, cleanly slicing them in half when suddenly, a message pops up before your eyes.

&#39;&#39;Level Up! You are now level 2&#39;&#39;

As you relish in your victory and perhaps the first positive message you&#39;ve recieved since the loops began, an unnatural gust of wind carries a sound to your.

//HOOT HOOT HOOT//

An eerie laughter verberates throughout the forest that sends tingles down your spine. It seems to come from no direction at all and yet, it seems to come from every direction. 

//Hoooo Hooo Hooo//

Karn lets out a small shiver as he clutches his shoulders, &quot;Ughhghghh, that owl sure knows how to give the heebie-jeebies&quot;

The laughter almost sounded as if it were mocking you, taunting you. You can&#39;t help but feel that Karn is on to something.

Once more a shiver runs down your spine, the laughter sounded excited this time as if it were anticipating you, waiting for you but as quick as it had came, as quick as it had ceased. The forest was suddenly filled with an ominous silence.

Even the usually bright and cheerful Karn carried a grim expression on his face. Haroon is silent, but his gaze is set towards the giant tree. 

Noticing that you&#39;re looking at him, he finally opens his mouth and says in a low voice, &quot;It&#39;s coming from the tree.&quot;

Although he spoke no louder than a whisper, his voice seemed to shatter the night causing Karn to flinch. You give a silent nod.

Karn lays sprawled out on the floor wide-eyed. He had snuck behind your back as soon as Haroon fired a spell to distract you, and neither of them believed that you would be able to counter them so easily. 

With a flick of your wrist, you had equipped a claymore which you used to easily disarm Karn and send him flying with a kick. Next, you cleave Haroon&#39;s firebolt spell with your sword before sending a heavy punch into his gut causing him to lose grip on his staff.

Haroon slowly tumbles to his knees clutching his stomach in pain as he heaves for air. He feebly stretches his arm out to grab his staff, but you quickly kick it to the side. 

Strangely, none of the people around seem to care or show any indication that they had even noticed what had just happened. You surmise that it&#39;s the System doing its job. Silence fills the room, interupted only by Haroon&#39;s coughs.

What do you do now?......

You&#39;re tired. How many more times would you have to die? Was this world really just a game? What meaning did your life have then? Was your life and world just someone else&#39;s playground? If players could be you or your friends, then what memories in your life were really real? What was made up by the system? Did Harold and Karn deserve a life like this? Why..why...why?

Questions after questions surfaced in your mind, then anger. Anger at the unfairness of it all, the unjustness of all. Indeed, the source of all these problems was the players and the system. Had they not existed....perhaps you would not have existed, but you find that a more pleasant alternative than living as a puppet in this doctored world.

Your gaze turns towards Haroon and Karn who are still on the floor...It would be so satisfying if just....they would be back in the next loop anyways.....just once...

Haroon quietly whispers a sentence into your ears.

You climb up the World Tree. It&#39;s surprisingly accomadating. The massive tree seems to have natural wooden stairs that spiral around it and you and your party are easily able to ascend beyond the night clouds. As you climb higher, you can can see your breathe in front of you as it grows chillier and chillier. 

After ascending past the clouds, you look up and notice the [[moon]] seems a lot closer and bigger than you have ever seen it. With the clouds gone you can make out the various branches of the tree, each the size and length of several football fields. In the distance you think you can make out dilapidated wooden tree houses all interconnected with wooden bridgesm, but they look abandoned. 

You talk little on the way up, the usually talkative Karn seems to be deep in thought and Haroon seems to be the same.

From the distance you can hear the sound of wings flapping.

//Hoot Hoot//

Then a shadow flies over your head, followed shortly by a strong gust of wind that almost knocks you onto the floor. 

When you look up you can see a giant owl the size of elephant in perched upon a branch of the world tree with it&#39;s back to you.

&quot;Time is stuck in a loop. This same day has repeated itself over and over for (print:$days) days, and it will perhaps continue to do so indefinitely,&quot; mused the Owl, &quot;The few who remember the loops can be counted on one hand.&quot;

&quot;You ask the wrong questions for that is not Atlam, however the answer remains a yes no matter how you interpret it,&quot; smiled the Owl.

Haroon, a bit quicker in the head than Karn jumps up, &quot;Not Atlam? Then that&#39;s an NPC who remembers the loops? But you said Atlam remembers the loops as well? Then...Atlam is here? But not him?&quot; questioned Haroon.

&quot;You are not wrong,&quot; replied the Owl, &quot;Your friend here is known as a bugged NPC. An irregularity and a by-product of an unforseen error by the System.&quot;

A smile spread across Wan Shi Tong&#39;s face, &quot;Allow me to re-introduce myself. I am Sys-Admin Wan Shi Tong, a subset of the System. As a part of the system, I shall reward you handsomely for helping in erasing this bug.&quot;

After all, it&#39;s not the first time he has killed you is it? A holographic monitor appears in the air showing a scene from the past.

You couldn&#39;t do it and find yourself knocked down onto the ground waiting for your last moments. You look up to the sky and the rabbit on the [[moon]] seems to be laughing at you.

You close your eyes. For some reason, you have a feeling this will be your last loop. You hear the flap of wings and a tremor as something lands next to you. 

&#39;&#39;System: Transferring Player Atlem rights to Sys-Admin Wan Shi Tong&#39;&#39;
&#39;&#39;System: Deleting Player Atlem&#39;&#39;
&#39;&#39;System: Adjusting History&#39;&#39;

&#39;&#39;The End&#39;&#39;

The System has erased the bugged NPC. Order to the world has been restored, and no one will remember the NPC or anything that the NPC has done. Strangely Wan Shi Tong was interested in your player rights for some reason, but that is no longer your problem. Rest well.

Thanks for playing!

Before he fades, he looks at you with a sad look.

As your sword pierces through Haroon&#39;s heart and he stares at you in fury as his body fades away. 

&#39;&#39;Player Atlam has defeated Player Haroon!&#39;&#39;

&quot;HAROON, NO!,&quot; Karn lunges at you too late as you turn to intercept his attack.

&quot;Believe me when I say I did it for your best interest. A test if you would, whether or not you could handle it.&quot;

&quot;In truth, it matters not, they will not remember come the next loop, nor may you be around for the next loop.&quot;

//&quot;hoot hoot hoot&quot;// the Owl laughed.

&quot;Come climb upon my back, I will not hurt you.&quot;

&quot;Now, now, don&#39;t give me that look,&quot; said the Owl, &quot;Have I Wan Shi Tong told any lies thus far?&quot;

&quot;Someone would like to see you and I&#39;m afraid only I can take you there.&quot;

&quot;Where to?&quot; asked the Owl with a smile, &quot;To the moon of course&quot;.

You will face Atlem at the end. If Haroon and Karn are still with you, and you haven&#39;t killed them off, you can convince Atlem to stop the loop without bloodshed. 

If you have killed Haroon and Karn in a previous life, Atlem will be hostile to you and you will battle him. He will mirror your stats, and if you win, you will become an System Admin. You will play a mini game where you read some Java Code to look for the error, and clicking the correct one will fix it. Following your previous motives, you will then shut the world out from outsiders and live for eternities as a God. 

Should you die, Atlem has erased his only threat in the world, and continues the loop to gain immeasurable power while everyone else stagnates. 

He finds life in here more exciting than the world outside, and explains his motifves to you for staying in the game. The game is aptly named SecondLife because life outside is horrible, and the replicated 21st century is the Golden Era in their world&#39;s history.

&quot;The answer is simple,&quot; said the Owl while ruffling his feathers, &quot;because the System created the loop on purpose, or at least a subset of it. Actions done by the System are considered legal, so we cannot do anything about it unless the Sub-System that originally performed the action does something about it or until someone higher up in the hierarchy notices it. But who is higher than the System in this world? None. Only those outside this world, but how many loops, days, years, decades will pass in this world before it is noticed in the real world?&quot;

[[Back-&gt;Ask Questions]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="103" name="Then which sub-system is causing this bug?" tags="" position="4933,739" size="100,100">&quot;Ah, finally asking the correct question!&quot; hooted the Owl, &quot;I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s someone you should be extremely familiar with yet unfamiliar with!&quot;

&quot;Hoot is it you ask?&quot; continued the Owl excitedly, &quot;DING DING DING! Correct! You guessed it! Your other half, Atlam!&quot;

//ahem//

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; coughed the Owl in embarassment as he reigned in his excitement, &quot;Very well, since we are short on time, let me explain. Did you not find this dungeon strange? Haroon&#39;s research definitely told you that this would be a goblin dungeon, so why did it lead to my domain?&quot;

&quot;I lead you here,&quot; continued the Owl solemnly, &quot;For only you can fix the loop. I told you that only the one who initiated the loop had the authority to end it, did I not? If only Atlam has the power to end the loop, then you who are effectively Atlam also has that power.&quot;

&quot;Atlam abused a bug to separate from your body and was able to take control of the part of the System that has the highest level of authority. As a side-effect you retained his player rights, and when he bugged the loop, he made it so that only he, a part of the System would remember the loop. What he overlooked was that this included all other Subsets of the System and himself or you.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know why he did it unfortunately,&quot; said the Owl, &quot;Although I am He Who Knows Ten Thousand Things, In the end I am not a human of either the real world or this world. If you really want to know, you will have to ask him.&quot;

&quot;That is enough questions,&quot; shook the Owl, &quot;I&#39;m afraid any longer and Atlem will take notice. climb upon my back. I will take you to Atlem, but unfortunately I cannot help you any further than that. A System cannot attack another Subset of the System. I would only get in the way. Now hurry.&quot;
